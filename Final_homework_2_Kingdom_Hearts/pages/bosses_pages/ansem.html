          Ansem, Seeker of Darkness is Xehanort's Heartless via Terra-Xehanort. His physical appearance closely resembles that of a youthful Master Xehanort. He serves as the main antagonist of Kingdom Hearts, Riku's "Reverse/Rebirth" story in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and Rank II of the real Organization XIII in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance and Kingdom Hearts III.
        </p> 

        <p class="paragraph">
          Due to him having intentionally separated his heart from his body and soul before he gave into the darkness, Ansem retained his selfhood, and intelligence after his transformation into a Heartless. Because he could think out his plans and pass for a human, he was able to destroy nearly every world in the Kingdom Hearts universe without revealing his identity, up until he confronted Sora at the Final Keyhole in Hollow Bastion.
          Gaining a body after his time as the Robed Figure, he gains the Heartless Emblem, becoming an Emblem Heartless.
