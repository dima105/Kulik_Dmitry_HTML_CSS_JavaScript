          Kingdom Hearts is the first game in the Kingdom Hearts series developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square Co., LTD) for PlayStation 2 and directed by Tetsuya Nomura. This action RPG game began as a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive Studios and feature a cast of Disney voice actors. The game was very well-received for mixing action and RPG gameplay elements and for incorporating Disney, Final Fantasy, and the game's own original characters.
